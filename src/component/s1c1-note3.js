          <p><code>nibbles</code>, <code>sextets</code>, <code>bits</code>, and <code>bytes</code></p>

          <p>If these provocatively named terms are familiar to you, then all we'll be doing is grouping three nibbles into two evenly divisible sextets and then evaluating these sextets to their final base64 representations. Pretty simple and that's the gotcha</p>

          <p>Want a little more explanation (and some interesting history)? Say no more and keep reading.</p>

          <h4>Bits</h4>
          <p>Many folks will conclude that a bit stands for binary digit (binary information digit if you want to get the precise J.W. Tukey attribution).</p>

          <p>While this is true, you lose meaning by merely stopping there and not differentiating binary digit and bit. Since we will be dealing with Information Theory quite heavily this becomes a worthy detour for understanding that will help us in having the right mindset when we think about cryptography.</p>

          <p>Claude Shannon, the founder of Information Theory, explained that while a binary digit can be 1 or 0, or any expression of two binary states, a bit represents a maximum amount of information that can be conveyed. The example given is a pint of milk. The pint can hold between 1 and 0 pint of milk, so a binary digit convey between 1 and 0 information. Connecting these binary digits can increase the amount of information that can be shared at a rate of 2^n.</p>

          <p>This aides conversations in Quantum Computing when facing superpositions where quantum bits can be in both states simultaneously. One of the more famous explanations of this being Schr√∂dingers Cat. We'll stop there regarding quantum computing. Just know the role it plays in cryptography is significant, one example leaving RSA completely broken through use of Shor's Algorithm which dismantles the core strength of RSA's intractibility.</p>

          <h4>Bytes</h4>
            <p>Let's hear from Bob Bemers explanation while he worked with Werner Bucholz at IBM (the man credited with coining the term). To do this we'll need to visit the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180102193409/http://www.bobbemer.com/BYTE.HTM" _target="blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">internet archives</a>.</p>

            <p>What Beemer goes on to explain is really what you can surmise from the term itself. A bite of something is the amount taken a chunk at a time. Changing it to <b>byte</b> eliminates the possibility of mistaking similarly named bit and bite. So now we are in 1964, the wildly successful IBM 360 mainframe breaks onto the scene. It is passing 8 bit chunks around in parallel and we find Werner Bucholz 8-bit byte catches on. A byte and 8 bits are now synonymous.</p>

            <p>You will see a note from Beemer at the end where he never cared for the term and preferred referring to them in their bases (octects) which is now seen as the preferred term for clarity. Now with ISPs and how we differentiate selling of services with the Megabit(Mb) vs MegaByte(MB), it is permanently etched into the way we speak around transfer of information and bandwidth across networks. 8 Megabits is 1 MegaByte...sorry Bob.</p>

          <h4>Nibbles & Sextets</h4>
          <p>In light of recent events in the previous section, Nibbles (sometimes spelled Nybble or Nyble to mirror it's byte relatives) have a history similar to that of the byte. Where it used to represent half of a byte regardless of base, today it is commonly in reference to 4 bits, half the quantity of the common 8-bit byte.</p>
          <p>So who coined the term? There's an anecdote on how Professor David B. Benson used it jokingly in the late 50's at Los Alamos and another reference frim Citibank implementing their own pre-ISO 8583 standard which used NABBLES for communication. At this point, it's been unowned long enough that we can call it public domain and leave it at that.</p>

          <p>We'll wrap up with this one liner on Sextets and the gotcha we discussed earlier. They are 6 bits capable holding 2^6 (64) values, the perfect size for our base64.</p>

          <p>In order to convert hex values into base64 you will notice we cannot do this a hex value at a time. The reason is because there are 4 bits, so we are two short. So let's grab another hex value. Now we have 8 bits in series but we are 2 bits too long. Grab another hex value and we can cleanly divide our 12 bits into two sextets. What happens if the entire hex value isn't divisible by our 6 bit boundaries? We pad the space at the end with the needed number of '=' signs to make ourselves divisible by 6.</p>
